# UCI-HAR-Dataset
Use smart phone sensor to identify user's ativity
Problem: 30 subjects carried smart phone on the waist to perform following acitvities: 
SITTING, LAYING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS


Goal: use accelerometer and gyroscope data to identify subject activity

Conclusions:

over 95% accuracy to separate Walking from Stable activity
less than 2 mins needed to perform separation
based on two sensor data, people's age, walking pattern might be derived

To improve:

Improvement in data collection
Improve still activity accuracy
More activity to separate features.
